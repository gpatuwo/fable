Fable
===================

Heroku link: http://fable-food.herokuapp.com/

## MVP
Fable provides farm-to-table recipes for what's at farmers markets this week in the Bay Area. The design of the site will rely on a clean grid format (like Pinterest's) but will be more similar in concept to [Food52](https://food52.com/recipes). This app will be built using Ruby on Rails and React/Redux with the following features:

 - New account creation, login and guest account
 - Infinite Scroll
 - Comments
 - Autocomplete search
 - Recipe upload/edit
 - Recipe saving
 - Recipe liking
